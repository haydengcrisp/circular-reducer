collaboration:

We observed the afterglow of the extremely bright GRB221009A 
(Dichiara et al., GCN 32632; Kennea & Williams, GCN 32635; 
Bissaldi et al., GCN 32637; Veres et al., GCN 32636; Lesage et 
al., GCN 32642) with X-shooter at ESO's UT3 of the Very Large 
Telescope (Paranal, Chile). The observations started at 
00:49:58.9 UT  (11.55 hr after the GBM trigger and 10.66 hr 
after the BAT trigger). The observation consisted of 4x600s with 
a spectral coverage between 3000 and 21000 AA.

We detect a very red continuum with absorption features that 
correspond to CaII, CaI and NaID at a redshift of z = 0.151. We 
also detect multiple features due to the Milky Wayâ€™s interstellar 
medium, due to the large Galactic column density of material 
along this line of sight. At this redshift the event has an isotropic 
equivalent energy of Eiso=2x10^54 erg (using the GBM fluence 
reported in GCN 32642), barring saturation effects in the 
Fermi/GBM fluence. This is within the upper end of GRB 
energetics. Further follow-up is strongly encouraged.

We acknowledge the excellent support provided by the Paranal 
staff, in particular A. Escorza and Zahed Wahhaj.
