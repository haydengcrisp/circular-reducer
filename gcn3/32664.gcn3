SUBJECT: GRB 221009A (Swift J1913.1+1946): Burke-Gaffney Observatory optical observations

I observed the optical afterglow of the extremely bright GRB 221009A =
Swift J1913.1+1946 (Dichiara et al., GCN Circ. 32632) remotely using
0.61-m f/6.5 Corrected Dall-Kirkham telescope of Burke-Gaffney
Observatory (Lane, 2018, RTSRE, 1, 119) on 2022-10-10. Twelve images
with exposures of 300 seconds and I—Å filter were obtained, midtime of
the first image is 02:06:45 UTC (11h56m after the trigger), midtime of
the last image is 03:09:02 UTC (12h58m after the trigger).

I clearly detected the afterglow and measured (aperture photometry,
without deblending) following magnitudes of the afterglow from
comparison to transformed (from Lupton 2005 formula) magnitudes of
nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS DR1 catalogue (Chambers et al.,
2016):

Magnitudes were not corrected for Galactic extinction.
